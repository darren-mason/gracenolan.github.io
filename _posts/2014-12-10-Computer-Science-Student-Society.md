Culture in Computer Science at University of Waikato. 

Title: Before I entered computer science I was confident with computers.

I was strolling down a wide path that was mottled with tree-shadows. listening to the the , I took in the lawn, ciccadas hum, trees, tall builsings. I had just left the recruiter's office. We had talked about starting my career in computer science. I was excited about learning more about how computers worked and having the tools to carve a fulfilling and challenging career. The enrolment office assured me that prior programming knowledge was not a prerequisite, so, I dived right in.


// describe this better:
Classes began and I started learning if statements and for loops. It was bewildering learning all the new terms for things. 

After the exhiliration from diving into something completely different disipated, I found myself desperatly dog paddling. 

My attitude towards computer science and my confidence with computers changed. I didn't know where it was coming from or why it was happening. I questioned if I belonged in this career. I felt like I was struggling to keep up with everyone else. /Why I am putting myself through this?/ 

// I can't swim but I dog paddle - Modest Mouse quote here

I refused to ask for help. I wanted to defy stereotypes and to prove to everyone that I could do it on my own. Even if I was clearly struggling, I would turn my head down and avert my eyes to any helping hand. /I'm a strong woman./

I would see the guys in my class working on their assignments and chatting with their friends. They talked boldly of the linux distro they are currently using and how it compares to the others. They laughed about the time when they installed this one really obscure and difficult to use version of linux (link to gentoo) for fun. What fun. 

They would boast about how they finished the lastest assignment in the wee hours of the morning. It only took them five hours. I passed by silently and my fingers curled around my laptop. That assignment took me more than a week to do. I was emotionaly/mentally drained from the highs and lows of learning to code. I was exhausted.

Before starting computer science, I was doing a Bachelor of Design Innovation from Victoria University in Wellington. After trying a computer science paper there, I had got indecisive about continuing design or switching to computer science completely. I thought that if I spent more time on what was challenging, it would no longer be a limitation on my creativity. My motivation was interactive design. I went overseas to think about my career for a bit. I decided I would change to computer science, but I made a promise to myself. That was to stop changing degrees and to stick it out. I had to stick it out.

I started making some more friends in the faculty. I started feeling more confident. I had some friends working in industry support me.

There is a snippet from Unlocking the Clubhouse of a student talking about her experience at Carnegie Mellon University.
"
Maria is a college student majoring in computer science. She tells us about her first semester in college and her feeling that her male peers know much more than she does about computing:
I keep reminding myself, “You have only been here a month. Give yourself some time, and you will learn something.” Meanwhile, I am sitting here thinking, “How come they know how to do this, but I don’t know how to do this? . . . I should have been prepared at the same rate they were.”
Maria says that when she asks her male peers how they already know so much about computing, they say, “Oh, we learned all of this on our own, years ago. We have been programming like this for ages.” Maria “tries not to be jealous.”
"

 This book helped me to observe and deconstruct the culture at University of Waikato. Suddenly a massive weight was lifted. I learned I had felt discomfort in the culture and interpreted it as a sign of my uselessness. It wasn't my fault that I was struggling.

"
The rub for women in computer science is that the dominant computer science culture does not venerate balance or multiple interests. Instead, the singular and obsessive interest in computing that is common among men is assumed to be the road to success in computing. This model shapes the assumptions of who will succeed and who “belongs” in the discipline."

I started talking with other students, both men and women. I shared with them how I was feeling, and they often interjected with "me too!". We talked about how I started feeling more confident after making some friends (even so, I still had barely any friends in my classes). I was surprised at how my male friends said this was the case for them too. I wondered if it was the same for everyone - even for those who are key players in perpetuating the culture. 

If this is a common problem, why hasn't anyone done anything about it yet?

So as a small social experiment, I decided to host a BBQ at the university. Who would turn up? What would happen? Could we invite some people from industry along? 

I had made some friends in the faculty thanks to living with a PhD student for a while. I felt that I had the support of the department to trial something like this. 

I roped some friends into helping out. They said that if we are going to ask people to come along, we needed a name for ourselves. 

Thus, the Computer Science Student Society (CS3) was born. 

At the event there were around 70 students who attended and was a very successful social experiment. I continued to organise events and forge networks and opportunities for this society for just over a year before stepping down. 

"We have found that women who persist are those who find a way to get grades they are satisfied with and who can develop a personalized view of computing and their place in it. Women who accept the prevailing culture as the norm and who continuously compare them- selves to this norm and find themselves coming up short are the ones who suffer the most."

Creating CS3 was my way of developing a personalised view of computing and my place in it.
