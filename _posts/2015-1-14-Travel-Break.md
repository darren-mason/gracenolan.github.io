title: The Luxury of Summer Break
---

I didn't want to think about the summer break until I had reached the end of the study year. I'd been fighting anxiety for a while now and in my pursuit to complete the year with some amount of sanity leftover, I reduced what I had to worry about. I had to drag the sweat off my brow, grind my teeth against the will to give up, and get to the finish line. 

During my recovery process, I had a throwaway idea... "I just want to run away to Melbourne for a few months... spend some more time with my family over there, escape computer science for while."

I mentioned it to a few people and they were supportive. I shelved the idea for later review.

Suddenly university was over and I hadn't organised my summer. With a bit of a push from my boyfriend, I ended up buying a one way ticket to Melbourne. Now I needed to make sure I could survive while I was there. 

I made a list of all the contacts and possible job leads. I followed them up, one by one, crossing off the deadends. 

I got two remote development work jobs lined up. One for a company I already worked for, and another for a tiny start up. 

I was all set for my survival. 

Another spanner in the mix was that I had received a scholarship to go to Indonesia for a camp from the university! This was scheduled to be in the first week and a bit of Feburary. I told the university my travel plans and they happily agreed to fly me to and from Melbourne. 

Christmas came and went, then it was off to Queenstown for me! This was the first stop in my two month long journey. 

It was wonderful spending some quality time with friends whom I hardly get to see now we live in different cities. The remote work hung over me. I carved out time to work on it, but one of the jobs I was doing was becoming quite demanding. I did my best to keep on top of it. 

Then off to Christchurch for two days to stay with Tim Bell. Tim is this awesome professor in computer science. He created CS Unplugged and is heavily involved in helping get CS into schools. It was great to have the opportunity to spend time with him and hear some of his ideas and things he's learned. 

Next was rushing off to Melbourne. When I arrived, Dad had already been there for a week already. We had a few days overlap. Those were packed with visiting friends and family. 

At this point there was quite a bit of pressure from one of the jobs that i was working. Our expectations were differents. What they needed could only come from a very experienced web developer, and what I could offer was very basic.

It's not surprising that this work fell through. I am reflecting on what I expected from this trip. 

I was searching for ways in which life might be different. I thought that if I was in a different location I could put away my worries for a while. 

I didn't have a plan and I don't have enough money. I am pushing the limits of my own "She'll be right" attitude. How far can I go for things to work out well in the end? How much will I learn this time? Who am I relying on? Is it fair?

When the Sagitto work fell through, I was borderline panicked. I couldn't go back to New Zealand because my flight tickets to Indonesia were  departing and returning to Melbourne. I felt locked in. And this was surprising. I guess I was expecting my trip to Melbourne to be a liberating experience. 

I feel like my youthful idealism is waning. I am more aware of risks and I spend more time imagining the realism of ways in which this trip could all go wrong. 

I think I need to spend some more time on actively relaxing (sounds like an oxymoron, doesn't it?). By this I mean to spend more time observing and appreciating the everything that is going on around me, and control the time when I am focusing on making certain the uncertain future.
